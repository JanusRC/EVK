EVK_CPLD

The original Janus Evaluation Kit contains a Xilinx XC2C64A CPLD which controls the UART routing.
The MODE0 pin will cause a HI-Z condition, allowing back biasing of PWRMON.

EVK_MCU

The new evaluation kit contains a small Atmel microcontroller (ATTINY24A) to handle proper power sequencing.
